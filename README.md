# Project for Udacity Android ND Popular Movies: Stage 1

## How to use:
Since this project uses The Movie DB API, user must have an API Key. This Key is not shared in this project, but it is referenced.
To include your own API key, you MUST create a resource XML file api_key.xml in the values folder. Inside the api_key.xml file, create a string called "api_key" and set it's contents to your own API key. 

## Example for api_key.xml file:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
    <string name="api_key">YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE</string>
</resources>
```
